# PM Reflection Prompts

## How did you come up with your idea?

I wanted to create something simple, useful, and practical for all types of people. Whether you are  an athelte, a student, or a corporate professional, anyone can greatly benefit from a well thought out schedule. The idea for a habit tracker came from noticing how many people struggle to stick to  goals and routines. A healthy and consistent routine is always a game changer for me, and I wanted to help others with that. I envisioned a tool that was visually engaging but minimal enough to avoid overwhelming users. The calendar and progress bar approach came from the idea that tracking progress visually is more satisfying and motivating.

## How well did the collaboration with your developer work?

Collaboration went smoothly. I provided a clear PRD outlining each core feature, structure, and design goals. We communicated to ensure that features were looked good and that things were coming along well. For example, I wanted the styling to be more visually appealing and friendly, so we communicated about that to make the app look better. Staying flexible while sticking to the product’s core goals and ideas helped keep development efficient and successful.

## What did you learn about writing requirements?

I learned that clarity and specificity is everything. Even small assumptions and parts of the overall app need to be spelled out in detail. I realized that breaking features into smaller, testable components helps both in development and in communicating the vision. Writing from the user’s perspective was also key to making the requirements meaningful, actionable, and easier to understand.

The more detailed and advanced you could make the pre-writing, the easier it is for the developer to envision and create ideas that align with your vision. 

## Did you use any AI tools in this process? How?

Yes, I used AI tools to refine my PRD and brainstorm feature ideas. This helped me present a more structured and efficient PRD, and ensured I could answer the developer’s questions effectively. AI also assisted in suggesting the progress bar feature, which enhanced the user experience and overall app usability.
