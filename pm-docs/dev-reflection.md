# Dev reflection prompts:

### How did you interpret and implement someone else’s idea?
- This was super challenging for me because I usually prefer having my own vision and following it through. I tend to get frustrated when someone else interferes with that vision. But this project was different—I really let John take ownership of the project and its direction. That made it easier for me to let him take the reins, and I used his vision as the foundation. From there, I was able to add features I thought would be beneficial based on my experience—things John hadn’t considered. Overall, it was a great learning experience. It’s always difficult to take on someone else’s vision when it’s not your own, but this project helped me grow in that area. I haven’t done much work before where I used a PM’s direction to guide my own work, so this was both challenging and valuable.


### What were the challenges in development and collaboration?
- One of the biggest challenges was communicating ideas—especially visual ones—through natural text. It was tough to fully grasp what John wanted just from his written or verbal descriptions. That said, I think I did a good job using my own judgment to interpret his input, and he provided helpful feedback over the phone, which made a big difference. Having that open line of communication was super helpful.
- Another challenge in the development process was that John and I are both very busy people. It’s easy to plan meetings and collaborate when both people have lots of free time, but it becomes much more difficult when schedules don’t align. That was definitely a challenge, but we were able to work through it with diligent scheduling, being flexible, and staying transparent and communicative about our availability. Planning ahead and avoiding last-minute work also helped a lot. I think this is a common issue between PMs and developers—quick, efficient, and clear communication is absolutely essential in the development process.


### Which parts did you use AI tools for, and what did you learn from that?
- For this project, the biggest challenge was translating between the technical and non-technical aspects. AI tools were incredibly helpful in bridging that gap. I took John's proposal and wireframes, pasted them into one chat, and used AI to help build a more fleshed-out project proposal and outline. That allowed me to clearly see everything that needed to be built and understand the full structure of the website. The AI also filled in any gaps John hadn’t covered.
- I prompted the AI to ask follow-up and thought-provoking questions, which helped guide the project further. For example, it might ask, “What exactly do you want displayed on the progress tracking page? Should it show priorities? What would be most important for your users?” That kind of prompting helped me make more informed decisions.
- Using AI in this way was great for idea generation, organizing thoughts, and translating messy or incomplete input into something structured and actionable. It saved a lot of time and helped ensure nothing important was missed. It was also helpful for brainstorming and building a foundational structure for the code.
