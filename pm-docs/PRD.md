# Project Title: Healthy Habit Builder

## One-Sentence Goal

Help users create and track personal health habits using a simple visual progress system.

## Core Features

- Users can create a custom health habit (e.g., "Drink more water", "Stretch daily") by entering it into a form.
- After submission, the user's goal is displayed on the page.
- A calendar layout allows users to check off days they complete their habit.
- A progress bar shows how many goals have been completed out of the number of total daily goals as a percentage.
- A reset button clears the checkboxes and lets the user start over with a new goal.

## Intended Pages

1. Homepage – Introduction to the website and a "Get Started" button
2. Create Goal – Input form to create a new habit
3. Tracker – Checklist with progress bar that updates in real-time (based on number of goals)
4. Contact – Simple feedback form (name, email, message)

## Design & Interaction Notes

- Clean, colorful, and efficient design
- Navigation bar for easy access between pages
- Progress bar should animate visually as goals are checked
